# Kari, the code generator

This project started as the code generator tightly coupled with [the main project it was used in](https://github.com/PunkyIANG/a-particular-project), but eventually became pretty much a standalone tool, easily extensible via plugins and very flexible. 

Kari is a Roslyn based tool. 
It can read the source code of your C# project, analyze it, and generate new type-safe code based on it.
This tool can often replace slow or annoying to write code based on reflection, boilerplate, or IL-emission; encourages declarative programming.

**Currently done:**

- Proper custom argument parsing;
- Dynamic plugin loading;
- Understading of Unity asmdef's (although each file must also explicitly specify the namespace of the asmdef it's in).


**Planned:**

- Installation of Kari as a standalone dotnet tool so that it can be used without cloning this repo;
- A friendlier way to define plugins. Most things that plugins need are defined in `Directory.Build.props`, and in the `Plugin.props`, but it's not convenient to import from anywhere else but Kari.Plugins at the moment.
- Decouple Baton (the python CLI from the main project) from Kari a bit further. The most prominent thing to refactor is the plugin template generation, which should be in Kari itself.
- Code generation for conventional csproj structured projects is probably broken. Solution-based code generation should also be added.
- Tests. Tests are kind of difficult when it comes to code generation, but it must be done at some point.
- Make a proper \[ä»®\] logo.


## Options

Kari is not designed for single-time use and is mostly for use in build scripts, which is why the argument parser is very strict:

- The arguments must be capitalized exactly like in the help message;
- There are no positional arguments, to reduce confusion for people reading the script;
- There are no shortened versions for arguments (I personally despise these, especially their use in scripts by Linux people);
- If you pass an unrecognized option, you ALWAYS get an error. Sure, this may break backwards compatibility, but I don't really care.

The arguments are passed by *single-dashes*, double dashes are not supported! 
Separate the arguments by commas if an argument is an array or a hash set. For example:

```
# Valid syntax
kari -option Value 

# Double dash, not allowed
kari --help

# Passing a list
kari -pluginsLocations "pluginsFolder,C:/absolute/path/plugins,Build/compiledPlugin.dll"
```

Options may be set via a json configuration file.
Kari automatically searches for a `kari.json` file in the working directory and next to the executable.
Additionally, paths to any number of configuration files may be passed on the command line:
```
kari -configurationFile "file1.json,C:/file2.json"
```

Arguments passed on the command line take precedence over ones imported from configuration files.
Also, configuration files specified first have precedence over the ones specified after.
Configuration files may include other configuration files, by specifying a property "configurationFile", which can either be an array of strings or a string with the relative or absolute path to another configuration file.

> Currently, the configuration file is searched for relative to the cwd.

Calling Kari without any arguments gives the following help message:

```

To see help from plugins, you need to pass the location of the plugin (any path to it) as an argument.

```

## More info

See `source/README.md` for more info about the code generator.


## Building

`dotnet build` should build all projects in the solution. It will fail the first time, because the generated files are not added in the compilation, but it will work the second time.

`kari.exe` can be run on its own. 
It's located in `Build\bin\Kari.Generator\Debug\netcoreapp3.1\kari.exe`. 
I'm going to add a more friendly way of calling it though.

In order to install it as a tool, currently do:

```
dotnet pack --configuration Release
dotnet tool update --global Kari.Generator --add-source Build\bin\Kari.Generator\Release
```

Which allows you to call kari like this:
```
kari
```

But I'm currently figuring out a simpler way of publishing and installing it.
